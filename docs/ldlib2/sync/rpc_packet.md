# RPC Packet
In vanilla or Forge-based mod development, maintaining custom network packets is often tedious.
You typically need to maintain boilerplate networking code:

* Define packet classes
* Register them manually
* Handle serialization and deserialization

To simplify this process, LDLib2 introduces an annotation-based RPC system using `@RPCPacket`.

With `@RPCPacket`, you can declare a static method **ANYWHERE** in your codebase and treat it as a network packet handler.
The annotated method itself becomes the packet’s execution target, and its parameters represent the data transferred between client and server.

* `@RPCPacket("id")`: Registers the method as an RPC handler with a unique identifier.
* `RPCSender` (optional): If declared as the first parameter, LDLib2 injects sender-side information, allowing you to distinguish whether the 
* Method parameters: All parameters (except RPCSender) are automatically serialized and transferred. call is executed on the client or the server. 

!!! note
    The types of parameters should be supoorted in the [Types Support](./types_support.md){ data-preview }.

RPCPacketDistributor
Provides utility methods to send RPC calls to the server, all players, or specific targets.

```java
// annotate your packet method anywhere you want
@RPCPacket("rpcPacketTest")
public static void rpcPacketTest(RPCSender sender, String message, boolean message2) {
    if (sender.isServer()) {
        LDLib2.LOGGER.info("Received RPC packet from server: {}, {}", message, message2);
    } else {
        LDLib2.LOGGER.info("Received RPC packet from client: {}, {}", message, message2);
    }
}

// send pacet to the remote/server 
RPCPacketDistributor.rpcToServer("rpcPacketTest", "Hello from client!", true)
RPCPacketDistributor.rpcToAllPlayers("rpcPacketTest", "Hello from server!", false)
```
