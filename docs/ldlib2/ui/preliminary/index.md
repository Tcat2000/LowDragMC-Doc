LDLib2 UI follows ideas similar to **Web UI**, **UI Toolkits**, and **fluent-style APIs**.  
All UI objects are built from a single base type called **`UIElement`**.  
Different behaviors and visual appearances are achieved by composing elements with **layout**, **styles**, and **events**.

If you have read the [Getting Started](../getting_start.md) guide,  
you may have noticed that **LDLib2 UI is highly flexible and modular**.

Below is a list of core pages you may want to explore next.
