LDLib2 provides powerful UI library based on the [`yoga`](https://www.yogalayout.dev/) layout engine. 
If you are struggling with GUI development, LDLib2 is definitely one of your best choice. Compared with the LDLib, LDLib2 has undergone a complete refactoring:

* modern UI layout system
* modern UI event system
* CSS-like stylesheet system
* data binding + rpc event
* massive plug-and-play components
* xml support + in-game UI visual editor
* xei / kjs supports
* completed document and usage examples

## Let's see what we can do with LDLib2
