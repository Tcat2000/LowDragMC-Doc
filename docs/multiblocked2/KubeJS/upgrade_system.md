# Dynamic recipe on the fly

## Upgrade System

Credit: @yellowcake3d 
For anyone in the future seeking for a way to make this sorta upgrade system, here's what I have, which is quite practically mostly from mierno, but instead I ended up using the `getTraitByName` and also had to turn on the "Always modify recipe" checkmark in the mbd editor
```js
MBDMachineEvents.onBeforeRecipeModify('mbd2:high_pressure_electrolyzer', (event) => {
    const mbdEvent = event.getEvent();
    const { machine, recipe } = mbdEvent;

    let itemTrait = machine.getTraitByName("item_slot");
    if (itemTrait == null) return;
    let storage = itemTrait.storage;
    let upgradeCount = storage.getStackInSlot(0).count;

    //parallel recipe modifiers, the more upgrades in the upgrade slot, the more recipes processed in parallel
    let parallelRecipe = machine.applyParallel(recipe, upgradeCount);
    let copyRecipe = parallelRecipe.copy();
    //speed modifier, makes recipe go 1% faster every new upgrade installed
    let reductionFactor = Math.max(1 - 0.01 * upgradeCount, 0.1);
    copyRecipe.duration = Math.ceil(recipe.duration * reductionFactor);

    mbdEvent.setRecipe(copyRecipe);
});
```

## Create dynamic recipes via KubeJS recipe builder

You can dynamically modify recipes by using the `onBeforeRecipeModify` event to apply a modifier and replace the original recipe. In most cases, this approach is sufficient. 
However, there are times when you may want more flexibilityâ€”such as removing, replacing, or appending ingredients. To support this, we offer an alternative method that allows you to define recipes in a way similar to KJS recipe events.

```js
MBDMachineEvents.onBeforeRecipeModify('machine:id', (event) => {
    const mbdEvent = event.getEvent();
    const { machine, recipe } = mbdEvent;
    
    // creat an empty builder
    // let newEmptyRecipeBuilder = recipe.recipeType.recipeBuilder();
    // create a builder with current recipe
    let builder = recipe.toBuilder();

    builder.duration(412) // modify duration
    builder.inputItems("apple") // append ingredient
    
    let fluidCap = MBDRegistries.RECIPE_CAPABILITIES.get("fluid")
    builder.removeOutputs(fluidCap) // remove all output fluid ingredients

    let newRecipe = builder.buildMBDRecipe();
    mbdEvent.setRecipe(newRecipe );
});
```
